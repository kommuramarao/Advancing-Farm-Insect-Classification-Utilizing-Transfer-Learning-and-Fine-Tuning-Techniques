# Farm Insect Classification Using Hybrid Deep Learning Model and the fine tuning methods

## Description

This project utilizes a hybrid deep learning model combining **MobileNetV3** and **InceptionV3** to classify farm insects accurately. By leveraging **transfer learning** and **fine-tuning**, the system efficiently processes input images, ensuring high accuracy while addressing class imbalance through weighted loss. Visualization tools such as confusion matrices and prediction results provide insights into the modelâ€™s performance.

The project aims to support sustainable agriculture by automating insect classification, enabling early pest detection, and improving decision-making in crop management.
